overall comment

Learn and improve in terms of understanding the requirement and analysing the code as per coding standard and also try to focus on smooth building codes with minimum deployment issues.
At the end of the day i ensure timely completion of all the task given and proactively reporting the same.
Learn new concept (technical,appliaction related… ) from my teammates.
